# Name Generator

This is a simple RNN to randomly generate names based on a dataset I found here on github https://github.com/hadley/data-baby-names/blob/master/baby-names.csv

The coursera course https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning/home/info has a similar exercise which was my inspiration but while my code follows the same basic outline I don't borrow any specifics from there.
